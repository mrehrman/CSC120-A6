- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My initial impression is that using inheritance means that it can take a lot less steps to implement elements of a program. By using a parent class, there's no need to repetitively write the same code if parts of it overlap.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I didn't find it that difficult to get the basics of inheritance working in my program. I had the most trouble with my hashtable in the Library class. I still have not gotten the print method to work correctly. I would recommend future students spend a lot of time looking at the documentation.
